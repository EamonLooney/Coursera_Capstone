This will then be joined with external data about populations by postcodes as well as average incomes by postcodes. \n\nHaving this data will then allow me to run various models, learn't in the course, to determine if there are any statistical revelance between the factors determined. The model that will be of the most interest will be multiple linear regression or polynominal regressions. This will be explored in a lot more detail when the data has been collected."
